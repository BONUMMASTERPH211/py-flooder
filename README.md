# py-flooder
Python script that floods form data with useless information

I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR HOW YOU USE THIS!

I use this to flood phishing websites with useless data so they have to sift through thousands of usernames/emails and passwords.

If you want to test this, you can use https://kcs.cx/test5 as a target. Just remember you may not be the only one using it, so be respectful to others :)
